<b>Dynamix Fanmade Chart Tutorial using Dynamaker, for Dynamite</b>

This repo contains a short guide for OmegaPi's DynaMaker Chart Editor. (originally called Dynaremix)
Dynamaker is a fan-made Dynamix Chart Editor tool that is a god-send because it gives random people like us the ability to create and play Dynamix charts which is almost impossible to do otherwise without prior related programming knowledge. The charts created can be uploaded onto Dynamite for testing.

This tool has many controls and features, although there are no clear instructions on how to use it on the page itself, it can get quite familiar and easy to use the more you use it. This unofficial guide aims to help you to familiarise yourself with Dynamaker's features and controls.

I had mostly written 1 year ago on 7 June 2019 for one of my friends, but I updated it slightly so the wall of text is more readable, the original wall of text made last year can still be accessed in the [relevant document]({{ baseUrl }}/Contents/Old%20Guide%20v1.0.txt).
