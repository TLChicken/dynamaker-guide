# Other Controls you never knew

## USEFUL - Undo & Redo - SAVE XML BEFORE USING - MIGHT CRASH DYNAMAKER

Keyboard:

**Shift + Left Arrow** : Undo (Removes last placed note / Puts back last removed note.)

**Shift + Right Arrow** : Redo (Opposite of Undo. Undo your undo.)



# Niche Controls

## Confusing until you Try It Out.

Keyboard:

**C / V** : Changes the fraction of a bar of the song (based on its BPM) that the notes you are going to place down are snapped to. Whenever the editor is started up, I recommend pressing **C** 4 times (set to 1/8 of a bar) or 5 times (set to 1/4 of a bar) after loading the song so it is easier to place down notes according to the beat.

**Shift + C / V** : Instead of the denominator of the fraction going up/down the preset values, holding down **Shift** will cause **C** to decrease the denominator by 1, and **V** to increase the denominator by 1.


- Preset values for the fractions of a bar that your notes get snapped to:

  **<-- C&nbsp;&nbsp;** 1/1  1/2  1/4  1/8  1/16  1/32  1/64  **&nbsp;&nbsp;+32 to denominator V -->**


**Hold Down Z**: Notes you place down while holding down **Z** are not snapped according to timing.
(Not working currently for me, has worked before more than 1 year ago. (Works in Dynaremix))
To overcome this bug, press **V** until you are able to put your note at the desired timing.

**Hold Down X** : Notes that you place down while holding down **X** are not horizontally snapped to 1 decimal place. (Can put anywhere along horizontal axis, in any column.)


**Shift + R** : Set speed of song to 0.1, speed of the chart to 1.0, and the note snap fraction to 1/32. (Not sure who uses this and for what.)


# Other Controls

### Only in Dynaremix (An older Version of Dynamaker / The other dynaremixv3 Version)

Keyboard:

**L** : Changes the graphics of notes to become simple lines. (Reduces Lag)

**B** : Toggle to invert mouse wheel scrolling.


<h2 id="BPM">BPM Change</h2>

Dynaremix contains a feature which allows you to change the chart's BPM in the middle of a song. This is supposed to let you be able to chart songs that have varying BPM. However, do take note that this feature is really buggy. Please save your chart first **BEFORE** using it.

### To access BPM Change Mode

1. Right Click to enter the right click menu.

2. Hover your mouse on the top right of the menu. (Select the "4th" Side)

3. Press the **BPM Change** Mode.

Note that after you place this down it cannot be removed (BPM Change delete feature was removed). So save your map first before using this feature in case something unexpected happens.


### Placing down BPM Change Object

While you are in **BPM Change** mode, hover your mouse over the bar that you want the BPM of the chart to change at and **Left Click**. (You can put it at any horizontal position.) Then key in the BPM that you want to change to in the pop-up box, and press "OK". _Results may be unexpected._



### How to use properly:

Will be updated again very soon in the future together with a Right Click Menu page.
