## Confusing until you try it out.

Keyboard:
**C / V** : Changes the fraction of a bar of the song (based on its BPM) that the notes you are going to place down are snapped to. I recommend pressing C 4 times (set to 1/8 of a bar) or 5 times (set to 1/4 of a bar) after loading the song so it is easier to place down notes according to the beat.


**Hold Down Z**: Notes you place down while holding down Z are not snapped according to timing. 
(Not working currently for me, has worked before)
To overcome this, press **V** until you are able to put your note at the desired timing.

**Hold Down X** : Notes that you place down while holding down X are not horizontally snapped to 1 decimal place. (Can put anywhere along horizontal axis.)
