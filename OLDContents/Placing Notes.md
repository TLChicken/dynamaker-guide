## Confusing Numbers around the Notes

This is a sample representation of a note:

*Bar No. + x/y*
        <=============>
*Horizontal Value*   *Note Size*

**ATTENTION QUITE CONFUSING AT FIRST, DONT REALLY HAVE TO KNOW:**

**Bar No. + x/y**: Bar No. is the bar of the song that you are about to place the note in. Exact timing depends on BPM of the song. (Music Theory)
y is the number of sub intervals of the bar that the note can be snapped to (adjusted by **C/V**, recommend 4 or 8, use 12 to place at 1/3 intervals in bars)
x is the sub interval that the note is being snapped onto.

The more intervals allowed to be snapped to means the shorter amount of time between each sub interval.

For a song with 4/4 time signature you can set y=4 then place down notes on 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4(not shown in editor) to have all 4 Beats in the bar to have notes on them. Or you can set y=16 and place notes at 4/16, 8/16, 12/16, 16/16 and achieve the same result. But having y at 16 means you can place more notes in between the timings of the 4 Beats in the bar

x/y is like which sub interval of the bar are u placing the note in, it represents the timing of the song that you are placing the note


**Horizontal Value** : The x coordinate on the axis that the note is being placed on.
