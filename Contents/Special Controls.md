## USEFUL - Undo & Redo

Keyboard:

**Shift + Left Arrow** : Undo (Removes last placed note.)

**Shift + Right Arrow** : Redo (Opposite of Undo.)



# Niche Controls

## Confusing until you Try It Out.

Keyboard:

**C / V** : Changes the fraction of a bar of the song (based on its BPM) that the notes you are going to place down are snapped to. Whenever the editor is started up, I recommend pressing **C** 4 times (set to 1/8 of a bar) or 5 times (set to 1/4 of a bar) after loading the song so it is easier to place down notes according to the beat.

**Shift + C / V** : Instead of the denominator of the fraction going up/down the preset values, holding down **Shift** will cause **C** to decrease the denominator by 1, and **V** to increase the denominator by 1.


- Preset values for the fractions of a bar that your notes get snapped to:

  **<-- C&nbsp;&nbsp;** 1/1  1/2  1/4  1/8  1/16  1/32  1/64  **&nbsp;&nbsp;+32 to denominator V -->**


**Hold Down Z**: Notes you place down while holding down **Z** are not snapped according to timing. 
(Not working currently for me, has worked before more than 1 year ago)
To overcome this bug, press **V** until you are able to put your note at the desired timing.

**Hold Down X** : Notes that you place down while holding down **X** are not horizontally snapped to 1 decimal place. (Can put anywhere along horizontal axis, in any column.)


**Shift + R** : Set speed of song to 0.1, speed of the chart to 1.0, and the note snap fraction to 1/32. (Not sure who uses this and for what.)


# Other Controls

### Only in Dynaremix (Older Version of the Chart Maker / Other dynaremixv3 Version)

Keyboard:

**L** : Changes the graphics of notes to become simple lines. (Reduces Lag)

**B** : Song goes in reverse.
